# Writing a storage module #
Each storage object is a class which needs to be derived from `storage.Storage`. You can have more than one storage object
per python file.

## Required components ##
You will need to override `store(self, results)` results is a python dictionary that is one of two formats. It is either
```json
{
  'Files': {
    'file1': {},
    'file2': {}
  }
  'Metadata': {
    'module1': {},
    'module2': {}
  }
}
```
or
```json
{
  'file1': {},
  'file2': {}
}
```
A storage module should support both, even if the metadata is discarded.

## Optional components ##
* You can override `DEFAULTCONF` in your storage module which will appear in the storage config file. This is a dictionary
of config options.
* You can override `setup(self)`. This should be anything that can be done once to prepare for mutliple calls to `store`
IE opening a network connection or file handle.
* You can override `teardown(self)`. This will be called when no more `store` calls are going to be made.
