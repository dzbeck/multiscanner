# Developing an Analytic

Enabling analytics and advanced queries is the primary advantage of running several tools against a sample, extracting as much information as possible, and storing the output in a common datastore.

The following are some example types of analytics and queries that may be of interest:

- cluster samples
- outlier samples
- samples for deep-dive analysis
- gaps in current toolset
- machine learning analytics on tool outputs
- others

Analytics development is currently ad hoc. Until interfaces are created to standardize development, the [Current Analytics](use/use-analytics.md) page might prove useful. It contains development details of the **ssdeep** analytic.
