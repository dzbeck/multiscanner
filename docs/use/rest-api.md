# REST API
Via its RESTful API, MultiScanner can be incorporated as a module in another project. Below is a simple example of how to import MultiScanner into a Python script.

``` python
import multiscanner
output = multiscanner.multiscan(FileList)
Results = multiscanner.parse_reports(output, python=True)
```

```Results``` is a dictionary object where each key is a filename of a scanned file.

```multiscanner.config_init(filepath)``` will create a default configuration file at
the location defined by filepath.
