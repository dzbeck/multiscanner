MultiScanner
============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mitre/multiscanner.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mitre/multiscanner)

Introduction
------------
MultiScanner is a file analysis framework that assists the user in evaluating a set
of files by automatically running a suite of tools for the user and aggregating the output.
Tools can be custom built python scripts, web APIs, software running on another machine, etc.
Tools are incorporated by creating modules that run in the MultiScanner framework.

Modules are designed to be quickly written and easily incorporated into the framework.
Currently written and maintained modules are related to malware analytics, but the framework is not limited to that
scope. For a list of modules you can look in [modules](modules), descriptions and config
options can be found in [docs/modules.md](docs/modules.md)

Requirements
------------
Python 3.6 is recommended. Compatibility with 2.7+ and
3.4+ is supported but not as thoroughly maintained and tested. Please submit an issue
or a pull request fixing any issues found with other versions of Python.


An installer script is included in the project [install.sh](<install.sh>), which
installs the prerequisites on most systems.

Installation
------------
### MultiScanner ###
If you're running on a RedHat or Debian based linux distribution you should try and run
[install.sh](<install.sh>). Otherwise the required python packages are defined in
[requirements.txt](<requirements.txt>).

MultiScanner must have a configuration file to run. Generate the MultiScanner default
configuration by running `python multiscanner.py init` after cloning the repository.
This command can be used to rewrite the configuration file to its default state or,
if new modules have been written, to add their configuration to the configuration
file.

### Analytic Machine ###
Default modules have the option to be run locally or via SSH. The development team
runs MultiScanner on a Linux host and hosts the majority of analytical tools on
a separate Windows machine. The SSH server used in this environment is freeSSHd
from <http://www.freesshd.com/>. 

A network share accessible to both the MultiScanner and the Analytic Machines is
required for the multi-machine setup. Once configured, the network share path must
be identified in the configuration file, config.ini. To do this, set the `copyfilesto`
option under `[main]` to be the mount point on the system running MultiScanner.
Modules can have a `replacement path` option, which is the network share mount point
on the analytic machine.

Module Writing
--------------
Modules are intended to be quickly written and incorporated into the framework.
A finished module must be placed in the modules folder before it can be used. The
configuration file does not need to be manually updated. See [docs/module\_writing.md](<docs/module_writing.md>)
for more information.

Module Configuration
--------------------
Modules are configured within the configuration file, config.ini. See
[docs/modules.md](<docs/modules.md>) for more information.

Python API
----------
MultiScanner can be incorporated as a module in another projects. Below is a simple
example of how to import MultiScanner into a Python script.

``` python
import multiscanner
output = multiscanner.multiscan(FileList)
Results = multiscanner.parse_reports(output, python=True)
```

Results is a dictionary object where each key is a filename of a scanned file.

`multiscanner.config_init(filepath)` will create a default configuration file at
the location defined by filepath.
